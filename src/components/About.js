				Staying current is key in our fast-paced world. Most people wouldnâ€™t even consider getting a physical morning newspaper anymore, so we depend on digital sources for our news.<br/> <br/> From this idea, I wanted to create an app that helps you get the news you want in a timely manner whether it is local or news around the world.<br/>

					<h2>How does this application work?</h2><br/>
					<p>
					This application is essentially an online web search engine specifically geared towards retrieving news articles around the world. <br/> 
					<br/> This is made possible through implementing <b>NEWSAPI</b> and <b>Microsoft Azure's News Search API.</b>

						<li>On default the search bar, will sort by top-headlines within the United States, if you get a response of zero articles you should switch <b>filters</b> from top-headlines to everything</li>
						<li>
						You can only access the weather forecast if you create an account and click calibrate in the top right navbar!
